# Homelab Templates

This repository contains setup templates and configuration files for various applications running in my home lab environment. It serves as a centralized location for maintaining and versioning infrastructure-as-code configurations.

## Homelab setup

The homelab uses a WireGuard VPN hosted on an Ionos VPS with a public IP to securely connect remote devices (thinkpad, medion, NAS, and mobile devices) in a private network. Services run on the thinkpad and medion laptops in my parents basement.

**Internet Access:** External clients connect via HTTPS to the public IP, where a Traefik reverse proxy routes requests to services running on the internal devices over the encrypted VPN tunnel.

**Internal Access:** Clients connected to the VPN can directly access services without going through the reverse proxy, providing access to services that are not reachable from the outside.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Maintain version control of configuration files
- Document setup procedures
- Backup setup procedures
- Share deployment configs with friends :)

## Getting Started

Each application folder contains the used setup (mostly docker-compose.yml) and the used configuration files with exempted secrets.
